One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

In this project, I have desgined a personal portfolio webpage where I would present myself to others and hopefully impress my recruiters. This site consists of a short introduction about myself, my educational history, my skills well as some of the amazing projects that I have done. I have also included my contact at the end of the site so that others can find me easily if they ever want to hire me or work together on a project.

Throughout the webpage, I have incorporated the key design princapals such as the color schemes, layout and typography. I have also implmented a few intresting interactions and animation with the help of javascript and css.


## Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

The main audience of this site are my potential employers as well as people with the same intrests, looking for collabaration on a project. The aim of the webpage is to showcase myself to them and and to create a platform where they can reach out to me. While desigining the webpage, I have researched intensively on the designs of other portfolio sites as well as some of the desgins that I came up by myself in the past, combined with extensive planning and countless trail and error, I have finally arrived at this desgin.

I have asked for feedback from others and everyone felt that this design looks appealing and approperiate. I have also ensured that the theme of this website is formal and has all the relavant details that the different audiences might be looking for, such as my qulifications, relavant skills and contact details. This webpage looks excatly like the wireframes I desgined and have included necassary improvements to make it much more interactive and responsive.

The layout of the webpage is neat and I have made clever use of the spaces provided so as to let the information and messages that I want to convey to my audience be conveyed in a clear and consise manner. I made use of some of the additional features to draw the attention of my audiences to the key details that they would be looking for in my website. I have also choosen fonts and font sizes that are easily readable while adding to the asthetics on my webpage.

### User Stories:
- I want to navigate through the different sections of a webpage quickly (navbar)
- I want to be able to easily read the words off a webpage (font and size)
- I want to be able to have a way to contact the person who made the webpage (footer/contact/social media)
- I want to be able to know more about the person (pictures and intro)
- I want to be able to see everything at one glance (layout and next button)
- I want to be able to view the webpage accross mutiple devices (responsiveness)
- I want to know more about the work the person does (projects and external links)

Finally, this webpage is the best way to showcase myself as I have desigined it from scratch and in my own style. I am confident that that all the information that my audiences are looking for has been included in this site and after looking at my portfolio webpage, they would reach out to me and hire me.
