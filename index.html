        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>I am currently a year one student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic pursuing a Diploma in Information Technology. I am passionate in programming.
        Since young, I had been fascinated by the advances in technology and the convenience that it brings to people. Ever since, I had aspired to become a software engineer one day, and would like to play a part in bringing innovative solutions and positive changes to the world through the use of technology.</p>
